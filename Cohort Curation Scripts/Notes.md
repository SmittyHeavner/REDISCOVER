**Just a few notes...**
- By popular demand, we created a clean and new GitHub repository that can be found here: Main Page (https://github.com/SmittyHeavner/REDISCOVER/tree/main). Note: We’re still working to update ReadMe.
- The key focus is the Cohort Curation Scripts/Sepsis path. Here is the link to the Cohort Curation Scripts: Cohort Curation Scripts (https://github.com/SmittyHeavner/REDISCOVER/tree/main/Cohort%20Curation%20Scripts/Sepsis). You can follow these in order (i.e., 00-07E) with no need to navigate to different folders!
- We made minor changes throughout to align table names (i.e., find “CURE_ID” and replace with “REDISCOVER”).
No substantive changes were made from the original GitHub Repository, so if you are more comfortable working with that code (Sent via email on 12/11/24) or have already made any appropriate fixes locally, please continue accordingly. 

Big shout out to Luke for helping me get all of this done! We have no testing environment so as always, please let us know if you encounter any issues.
